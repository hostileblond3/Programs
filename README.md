# Programs Repository

Welcome to the hostileblond3/Programs repository!  
This repo is organized to help you upload, share, and manage your programs by programming language.

## Folder Structure

- `python/` — Python scripts and projects
- `javascript/` — JavaScript programs and files
- `java/` — Java programs and source code
- `c/` — C language files and projects
- `cpp/` — C++ files and projects
- `go/` — Go language files
- `ruby/` — Ruby scripts
- `csharp/` — C# files and projects
    - `VisualStudioProjects/` — Full Visual Studio project folders go here
- `other/` — Programs in other languages or miscellaneous files

## How to Upload

1. Choose the folder matching your program’s language.
2. Upload your files via GitHub web interface or git command line.
3. For Visual Studio projects, upload the entire folder (with `.csproj`, `.sln`, etc.) into `/csharp/VisualStudioProjects/`.
4. If your program doesn’t fit the above categories, use the `other/` folder.

Feel free to add more folders if you use additional languages!

Happy coding!
